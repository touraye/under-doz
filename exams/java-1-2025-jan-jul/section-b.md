Section two

Instruction: Answer any 3 questions. Each question carries 5 marks.

1. What is your understanding of a global variable? (1 mark)

   1. Use the code snippet, create two variables, make one a global variable and a local variable:

      ```java
      public class Test {
      	public static void main(String[] args) {
      	
      	}
      }
      ```

      (2 marks)

   2. What is the difference between a pre increment (`++b`) and a post increment (`b++`). (2 marks)

2. Create a function that will take a person's name and age as input and print them to the console. (2marks)

   1. List two differences between a primitive and a reference type in Java. ( 2 marks) 
   2. What is an expression? (1 mark)

3. Discuss about initialization and declaration of a variable. (2 marks)

   1. Give an example for each. (1 mark)
   2. What is considered a Boolean operator? (1 mark)
   3. Formulate a statement or an expression with all Boolean operators. (1 mark)

4. You are given an Array with five empty slots to fill in with any number; `int[] n = new int[5];`:

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < ; i++) {
       n[] = i;
   }
   ```

   1. Complete the Algorithm, make sure the `n` Array got populated with all the values of `i`. (2 marks)
   2. Print all the elements from the `n` Array. (1 mark) 
   3. Discussion about Array as a Data Structure. (2 marks)

5. What is an Object? (1 mark)

   1. Suppose a class is defined: 

      ```java
      class Person{
          String name;
          int age;
      
          @Override
          public String toString() {
              return "Person{" +
                      "name='" + name + '\'' +
                      ", age=" + age +
                      '}';
          }
      }
      ```

      Create an object of `Person`. (1 marks)

   2. Assign values to person `name` and `age`. (1 mark)

   3. Print person information by invoking the `toString()` method (2 marks)

6. List all comparison operators. (1 mark)

   1. Consider this: `int a = 9;` and `int b = 5;`. Compare these two variables with all the operators listed above. ( 2 marks).
   2. What are logical operators? (1 mark)
   3. List all the logical operators. (1 marks)
