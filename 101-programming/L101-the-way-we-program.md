# The Way We Program

Thinking like a computer scientist, this way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. 

**Think like a mathematician:**

Computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas(specifically computations).

**Think like an engineer:**

Computer scientists design things, assemble components into the system and evaluate tradeoffs among alternatives.

**Think like s scientist:**

Computer scientists observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. 

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem-solving. Problem-solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. Learning how to program is nothing more than problem-solving,

# Programming Languages

Human communicates with one another using neutral language like English, Arabic, Chines etc. On the other end computer understand only zeros and ones(binary) which is referred to as Machine language or assembly language also called low-level language. high-level languages are not directly understood by computers, they have to go through some processes.

High-level languages are English-liked text-bases that are very easy to write, read and understand they are unlike low-level languages which are hard to write, read, and understand. Examples of high-level languages are  Java, JavaScript, Python etc.



| Low-level language                                           | High-level language                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Understood only by computer                                  | Understood by human only                                     |
| Take less time to run                                        | Take longer time to run                                      |
| Hard to write and read                                       | Easy to write and read                                       |
| Programs written in lower level languages cannot run on multiples computer systems | Programs written in higher level languages can run in almost any kind of computer systems |
| They run directly by the computer                            | They are run by computer with the help of other programs     |
| Only few specific program are written in low-level language  | Almost all the programs are written in high-level-language   |

High-level languages are in demand due to numerous benefits. Hence, programs written in a high-level language are not directly understood by computers. Some other programs were developed to ease the situation, and these are called interpreters, and compilers.

### Interpreter

An interpreter reads programs written in high-level in sequence, reading lines while performing computation. Examples are JavaScript, Python etc.

### Compiler

A compiler reads the whole programs written in high-level languages, it does this by translating it before the program starts running. A compiler translates the program which is written by the programmer(source codes) to object code aka executable which is later run by the computer.

## What is a program

A program is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer to perform specific commands or computations. These commands or computations can be in a form of adding two numbers (mathematics), taking input from a user and saving it to the database, or displaying information on the user's device. Every other program out there has some things in common despite being written in different languages. Languages that use compilers are C, C++, Java etc.

Below are common patterns that every program operators be it a few lines of codes or a huge program:

**input**: 

Get data whether from the keyboard, a file, or even a remote server

**Output:**

Displaying some information to a user device such as their screen.

**Math:**

Performing some arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, or modules 

**Conditional execution:**

Programs do not just execute all together in most cases, certain condition will stop certain part of the program from executing.

**Repetition:**

The program can keep repeating certain actions over and over
