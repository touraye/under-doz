# About The Computer

Before embarking on our journey into the world of programming, it is essential to have a solid understanding of computers. As we all know, a computer is an electronic device that manipulates information provided to it and produces a desired outcome. It is beneficial to comprehend how a computer manipulates information, especially for a computer science student.



### Natural And Formal Languages

Natural Languages: These are languages people use to communicate among themselves. These kind of a languages evolve naturally though people might contribute to the betterment of the these language, but either it's creation.

Formal Language: These are languages people have created for a specific purposes. These kind of languages are Mathematic language and programming languages. 

For our interest we will consider a programming language. Formal Languages have these key components; token, syntax, and parsing. 

In programming languages, a **token** is a basic building block that represents a single element of the source code.  Common types of tokens include keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and punctuation symbols. You will see more later in the course

Each of these elements is a token, and they collectively form the syntax of a programming language. 

In programming, **syntax** refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs must be written in a particular programming language. These rules define the correct structure and format that source code must adhere to for the code to be valid.

**Parsing** in a programming language involves analyzing the structure of the source code to determine its syntactic correctness according to the language's grammar rules.



# Programming Languages

Humans communicate with each other using natural languages such as English, Arabic, Chinese, etc. On the contrary, computers comprehend only zeros and ones (binary), known as Machine language or assembly language, also referred to as a low-level language. High-level languages are not directly understood by computers; they need to undergo certain processes.

High-level languages are text-based, similar to English, making them easy to write, read, and understand. In contrast, low-level languages are challenging in terms of writing, reading, and understanding. Examples of high-level languages include Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.



| Low-level language                                           | High-level language                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Understood only by the computer                              | Understood only by humans                                    |
| Takes less time to execute                                   | Takes longer time to execute                                 |
| Difficult to write and read                                  | Easy to write and read                                       |
| Programs written in low-level languages cannot run on multiple computer systems | Programs written in high-level languages can run on almost any kind of computer system |
| Executed directly by the computer                            | Executed by the computer with the assistance of other programs |
| Only a few specific programs are written in low-level language | Almost all programs are written in high-level languages      |

High-level languages are in demand due to their numerous benefits. Consequently, programs written in high-level languages are not directly comprehended by computers. To facilitate this process, other programs were developed, known as interpreters and compilers.

### Interpreter

An interpreter reads high-level language programs sequentially, processing lines and performing computations. Examples include JavaScript, Python, etc.

### Compiler

A compiler reads entire programs written in high-level languages by translating them before the program begins running. It translates the program, written by the programmer (source codes), into object code, also known as an executable, which is later executed by the computer.

## What is a program

A program consists of a sequence of instructions instructing a computer to execute specific commands or computations. These tasks may involve mathematical operations, such as adding two numbers, interacting with users to collect input and store it in a database, or presenting information on the user's device. Despite being written in different languages, all programs share certain commonalities. Examples of languages that use compilers include C, C++, Java, etc.

Below are common patterns that apply to every program, whether it's just a few lines of code or a large-scale application:

**input**: 

Retrieve data, whether from the keyboard, a file, or even a remote server.

**Output:**

Displaying information on a user's device, like their screen, is essential for user interaction and engagement. This process involves presenting data visually, whether it be results, prompts, or graphical elements, to enhance the user experience and facilitate effective communication with the program. In console-based applications, this presentation of data occurs through the command line interface, demonstrating its fundamental role in creating a user-friendly interface, particularly in scenarios where graphical interfaces may not be applicable.

**Math:**

Performing arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, division, and modulus, involves carrying out mathematical calculations within a program. These operations enable the manipulation and computation of numerical values, providing the program with the capability to process and analyze data, facilitating a wide range of functionalities, from basic calculations to complex mathematical algorithms.

**Conditional execution:**

Typically, programs do not run in their entirety. Instead, specific conditions may arise, preventing certain sections of the program from being executed. This introduces a concept known as conditional execution, where the program's flow is influenced by predefined conditions, allowing for more controlled and adaptive behavior.

**Repetition:**

The program possesses the capacity for iterative execution, enabling the repetition of specific actions. This loop functionality is valuable for automating repetitive tasks and implementing iterative algorithms, enhancing program efficiency and flexibility.
