# The Way We Program

Thinking like a computer scientist, this way of thinking combine some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. 

**Think like a mathematician:**

Computer scientist use formal languages to denote ideas(specifically computations).

**Think like an engineer:**

Computer scientist design things, assembling components into system and evaluate tradeoffs among alternatives.

**Think like s scientist:**

Computer scientist observe the behavior of a complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. 

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem-solving. Problem-solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. Learning how to program is nothing more than problem-solving,

# Programming Languages

Human communicates to one another using neutral language like English, Arabic, Chines etc. On the other end  computer understand only zeros and ones(binary) which is refers to as Machine language or assembly language also called low-level language. high-level language are not directly understood by computers, they have to go under some process.

High-level language are English-liked text base which are every easy to write, read and understand they are unlike low-level language which are hard to write, read, and to understand. Example Java, JavaScript, Python etc.



| Low-level language                                           | High-level language                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Understood only by computer                                  | Understood by human only                                     |
| Take less time to run                                        | Take longer time to run                                      |
| Hard to write and read                                       | Easy to write and read                                       |
| Programs written in lower level languages cannot run on multiples computer systems | Programs written in higher level languages can run in almost any kind of computer systems |
| They run directly by the computer                            | They are run by computer with the help of other programs     |
| Only few specific program are written in low-level language  | Almost all the programs are written in high-level-language   |

High-level language are in demand due numerous benefits. Hence, programs written in high-level language are not directly understand by computers. Some other programs where developed to ease the situation, and these called **interpreter**, and **compiler**.

### Interpreter

Interpreter reads programs written in high-level in sequence, reading lines while performing computation. Example are JavaScript, Python etc.

### Compiler

Compiler reads the whole programs written in high-level languages, it does this by translating it before the program start running. Compiler translate the program which are written by the programmer(source codes) to object code aka executable which are later run by the computer.

## What is a program

A program is sequence of instructions that tells a computer to perform a specific commands or computations. These commands or computations can be in a form of adding two number(mathematics), taking input from user and save it to the database, or displaying information to user device. Every other program out where have some things in common despite written in different languages. Languages that uses compiler are C, C++, Java etc.

Below are common patterns which every program operators be it a few lines of codes or huge program:

**input**: 

Get data whether from the keyboard, a file or even a remote server

**Output:**

Displaying some information to user device such as their screen.

**Math:**

Performing some arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, or modules 

**Conditional execution:**

Programs do not just execute all together in most cases, certain condition will stop certain part of the program from executing.

**Repetition:**

Program can keep repeating certain action over and over
