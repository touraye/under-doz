# About The Course

This course will introduce you to the core programming concepts without using any programming language to begin with then later move into Java. You will learn the fundamentals of Java and move into advanced topics.

I will break things down into small modules and slowly but surely move into complex topics. The course will be fully hands-on meaning we will keep our hands dirty (learning by doing) throughout.

The course materials provide some core fundamentals of programming. I intend it to be a self-taught phase, meaning anyone who wants to learn how to code can review the course material.  In the first lesson [intro to programming](https://github.com/touraye/under-doz/tree/main/intro-to-programming), proceed to your desired programming language. Here we will use Java.

If you have once coded I still encourage you to go through the first lesson as there is always room for improvement.

**Prerequisite:** *No prior programming knowledge is required as I will introduce you to programming, but you need to have a working computer(laptop) basic computing skills, and a GitHub account.*
