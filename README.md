# About The Course

This course will introduce you to the core programming concepts without using any programming language then later move into java, learn about the web, and database and version control(Git and GitHub). We will learn the fundamentals of Java and move into advanced topics, learn the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript then React, and also take a deep dive in the world of Relational Databases by learning SQL(MYSQL).

We will break things down into small modules and then into complex topics. The course will be fully hands-on meaning we will keep our hands dirty (learning by doing) throughout.

The course materials provides some core fundamentals of programming. I intend it to serve a self-taught phase, meaning anyone who want to learn how to code and go through the course material in first lesson `101-programming`, and proceed to of their desired programming language. Here we will be looking the two most popular programming languages(Java, and JavaScript).

If you have once coded I still encourage to through the first lesson as there is always room for improvement.

**Prerequisite:** *No prior programming  knowledge is required as I will introduce you to programming, but you need to have a working computer(laptop) and basic computing skills, and a GitHub account*
