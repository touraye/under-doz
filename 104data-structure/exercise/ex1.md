# Assignment 4

Study the code below and answer the questions that follows.

The algorithms below create an array twice the size of the data array called  `temp` and fill it with all the items from the data array. Suppose the `data` array  consists of the following items; `[12, 4, 10, 19, 3]`. 

```java
int[] temp = new int[this.data.length * 2];  
for (int i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++){ 
		temp[i] = data[i]; 
} 
data = temp; // data is reassigned with temp 
```

1. Explain why the `temp` array will be twice the size of the `data` array.   
2. Explain how the items from the `data` array will copied to the `temp`  array.
3. Finally, output the content of the `data` array.
