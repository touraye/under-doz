# Control Flow Statements

Programming in general evolves around two things: *data*  and *instruction*. We have explore the concept behind [data]() and in this module we will take a deeper dive into the instruction part. Instructions are two thing controls structures or flows and [subroutine]().

Control structure dictate the order of the program execution, initially our program follows the normal flows of execution, instructions are executed from top to button in a sequential order.

However, we will kick-start off with [**boolean expression**]() which founds part of the decision making body of a program and later dive into the six types controls structures.

Topic to covered:

1. [Boolean expression]()
2. [Block statement]()
3. [`if` statement]()
4. [Switch statement]()
5. [While loop]()
6. [Do while loop]()
7. [For loop]()
