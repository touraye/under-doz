# Program Execution Flow

The program you interact with goes through a series of steps. These steps are in chronological order, a step-by-step sequence without the order our program will not be able to execute correctly, and therefore, the intended instructions will not be executed correctly.

## Writing Program Instruction:

 The very first phase is writing code (program instruction) using a high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C, JavaScript). This is done by writing an instruction, which is referred to as source code. 

### Source Code

Source code programming is writing instructions in a programming language to create software. This code is the foundation of all software applications, websites, and digital tools. Steps involve:

1. A programmer writes source code in a programming language like Python, C++, or Java.
2. The source code is saved in a file.
3. A compiler or interpreter translates the source code into machine code.
4. The machine code is processed by the CPU in a computer. 

## Translation

Translation is the act of turning a high-level code written by a programmer into machine code. This process can be done differently depending on the type of programming language being used. The code is either being interpreted or compiled:

### Interpreter

A **interpreter** is a specialized software program that translates and executes source code written in a high-level programming language (such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby) line by line, without generating a separate executable file. This allows for immediate execution, making interpreters useful for scripting, debugging, and interactive programming.

### **How It Works:**

1. **Lexical Analysis** – The interpreter scans the source code and breaks it into tokens (small meaningful units).
2. **Syntax Analysis** – It checks the structure of each line of code to ensure it follows the language’s rules.
3. **Semantic Analysis** – The interpreter verifies the logic and meaning of the current line.
4. **Immediate Execution** – Instead of translating the entire program at once, the interpreter converts and runs each line sequentially.
5. **Error Handling** – If an error occurs, execution stops immediately, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Compiler

A **compiler** is a specialized software program that translates the entire source code written in a high-level programming language (such as C, C++, or Java) into machine code or an intermediate code before execution. This process enables computers to understand and execute the program efficiently.

### **How It Works:**

1. **Lexical Analysis** – The compiler scans the source code and breaks it into **tokens** (small meaningful units).
2. **Syntax Analysis** – It checks the structure of the code to ensure it follows the rules of the programming language.
3. **Semantic Analysis** – The compiler verifies the logic and meaning of the code.
4. **Optimization** – It improves the code by making it more efficient before translation.
5. **Code Generation** – The optimized code is converted into machine code or an intermediate form.
6. **Linking & Execution** – The final machine code is linked with necessary libraries to generate an executable program.

Summary:

* You learn about program instruction
* You learn about source code that make a program
* You learn about translating a program
* You learn about Interpreter and compiler
