# Program Execution Flow

The program you interact with goes through series of steps. These steps are are in chronical order, a step by step sequence without the order our program will not be able to execute correct and therefore, the intended instruction signed will not  be executed correctly.

Some of the steps involve in the program execute phase.

## Writing Program Instruction:

 The very first phase a is written using a high-level-programming language (e.g, Java, Python, C, JavaScript). This is done writing an instruction which is refer to as source code. 

## Translation

Translation is the act of turning a high-level code written by a programmer into a machine code. This process can be done in different way depending the type of programming language been used. The code is either being interpreted or compile:

1. Interpreted Language: The code is executed **line by line** using an **interpreter** at runtime. No separate executable file is generated; the interpreter directly translates instructions. Programming language; Python, JavaScript, etc.
2. Compiled Language: The source code is converted into **machine code** (binary) using a **compiler**. The compiled code is stored in an **executable file** (e.g., `.exe` on Windows). Programming languages C, C++
3. Hybrid Languages (Java, C#): The code is first compiled into **intermediate bytecode**. A **virtual machine** (e.g., JVM for Java) executes the bytecode.
