This module introduces one of the core fundamentals of computation in computer systems. For a computer to process any given instruction, it relies on two essential resources: **time** and **space**. Understanding how algorithms consume these resources is key to evaluating their efficiency. This module will explore how time and space influence algorithm performance.

Topics to cover:

- [Time Complexity]()
- [Space Complexity]()

This module also includes hands-on exercises, which are provided in the exercises section. In these activities, you will read and analyze algorithms, evaluate their time and space complexity, and compare different approaches. As a demonstration, you will examine and distinguish between linear search and binary search algorithms.
