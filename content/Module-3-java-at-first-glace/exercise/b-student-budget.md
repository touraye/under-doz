# **Student Budget Program**

A **small budget program** is an excellent learning tool because it connects **abstract programming concepts** to a **real-life problem** students already understand.

Through this assignment, students are able to:

- Apply **data types and values** to represent real financial information.
- Use **operators and operands** to perform calculations such as totals and balances.
- Understand how **expressions** produce values from calculations.
- Write **statements** that execute meaningful actions.
- Practice **string concatenation** to present results in a human-readable format.
- See how small pieces of code work together to solve a practical problem.

This reinforces the idea that programming is not just syntax, but a way of **modeling real-world situations logically**.

## **Assignment: College Student Budget Program**

### **Objective**

To design a simple Java program that models a **basic personal budget** using core programming concepts.

------

### **Problem Description**

As a college student, you often work with limited funds. In this assignment, you will create a Java program that calculates and displays a **simple monthly budget** based on your income and expenses.

------

### **Requirements**

Your program must include the following components:

#### **1. Data Representation**

Use appropriate **data types** to store:

- Student name (`String`)
- Monthly allowance or income (`double`)
- Food expenses (`double`)
- Transportation expenses (`double`)
- Study-related expenses (`double`)
- Savings goal (`double`)
- A boolean value indicating whether the student stayed within budget (`boolean`)

------

#### **2. Operators, Operands, and Expressions**

- Use **arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`) to calculate:
  - Total expenses
  - Remaining balance
- Each calculation must be an **expression** that evaluates to a value.

------

#### **3. Statements**

- Assign values to variables using **assignment statements**.
- Use **output statements** to display results in the console.

------

#### **4. String Concatenation**

- Combine strings and variables to produce **clear, readable messages** such as:
  - Budget summary
  - Total expenses
  - Remaining balance
  - Budget status

------

### **Expected Output**

When the program runs, it should print a **well-formatted budget report** similar to a short financial summary for a student.

------

### **Assessment Criteria**

- Correct choice of data types
- Proper use of operators and expressions
- Clear distinction between expressions and statements
- Effective use of string concatenation
- Readable and well-structured output
