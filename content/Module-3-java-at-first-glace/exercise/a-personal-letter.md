# **Assignment: String Concatenation in Java**

### **Objective**

The goal of this assignment is to help you practice **declaring String variables** and **combining them using string concatenation** to produce a meaningful and readable output.

------

### **Task Description**

Write a **Java program** that generates a **self-introductory letter** about you.

Your letter should include the following personal information:

- Full name
- Age
- Gender
- Home address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Job status
- Marital status
- Area of study
- Family information

------

### **Instructions**

1. Declare **separate variables** to store each piece of personal information.
2. Create **one main String variable** (you may name it appropriately) that represents the full letter.
3. Use **string concatenation (`+`)** to combine the individual variables into a single, well-formatted letter.
4. Ensure the letter is **readable**, uses proper spacing and punctuation, and sounds like a real introduction.
5. Print the final letter to the **console**.

------

### **Expected Output**

When the program runs, it should display a **clear and complete self-introduction**, with all information coming **from the variables** you declared.

------

### **Important Rules**

- Do **not** hard-code the full letter in one string.
- All personal details must come from **variables**.
- Use **string concatenation**, not string templates or formatting methods.
- The program must compile and run successfully.

------

### **Assessment Criteria**

- Correct use of `String` variables
- Proper string concatenation
- Code readability and structure
- Clear and well-formatted console output
