# Function

Imagine building a program with hundreds of lines of code, and for sure, with those hundreds of lines of code, some appear over and over. You will be amazed at how much you will repeat yourself if you start writing complex programs. Not even repeating yourself, your code will become a re, and beco, let alone read and even maintain.

This module introduces functional programming a programming paradigm where software code is chunked i.e. written into small modules and can be reused whenever needed.
