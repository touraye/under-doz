# Exercise One

***Part 1***

In this exercise, you will utilize the knowledge gained from [part-a of module-4](https://github.com/touraye/under-doz/blob/main/content/Module-4-useful-java-classes/-a-taking-input-from-the-keyboard.md). Your task is to refactor an existing Java program to incorporate the Scanner `System.in` capabilities of reading input from a user keyboard.

The output of the initial program:

<img src="/assets/student-expense-tracker/ex.jpg" />

Refactoring your program:

1. Create an instance of a `Scanner` class and name the object as `input`
2. Using the Scanner object `input` you need to prompt the user to enter their information such as; `firstName, midName, lastName, address, pass, lunch, numberOfSemester`.



***Part 2***

Initialize two variables of type `int` and assign them with any desired values. Make use of the comparison and logical operators discussed.

Hint: suppose 

```java
/*
    COMPARISON OPERATORS
    >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
    LOGICAL OPERATORS
    &&, ||, !
 */
int num1 = 4, num2 = 3, num3 = 12, num4 = 1;
boolean a = num1 > num2 || num3 < num4;
//Complete the rest of the comparison using the comparison operator and logical operators as seen above
boolean b;
boolean c;
boolean d;
boolean e;
boolean f;
```

Output:

 `4 > 3 || 4 < 1 is: true` 

Your program is expected to compile, execute correctly, and therefore produce the expected output at the end of the day.
