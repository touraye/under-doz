# Control Flow Statements

### **What Are Control Flow Statements?**

Control flow statements **determine the order** in which instructions are executed in a Java program. They allow **decision-making, looping, and branching**, enabling more dynamic and efficient code execution.

Java has three main categories of control flow statements:

1. **Decision-Making Statements** (Conditional Statements)
2. **Looping Statements** (Iteration)
3. **Branching Statements**
