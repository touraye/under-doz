# Command Line Basic

## Command Line Basic

Here we will learn how to use the command line to how the basic operation; create folder, file and compile and run Java codes.

## What is a command line:

 A command line is a text-based interface where users type commands to interact with the operating system or software, allowing tasks like file manipulation, program execution, and system configuration.

### features of a command line:

1. **Text-Based Interface**: Users input commands as text.
2. **Direct System Access**: Provides direct interaction with the operating system.
3. **Script ability**: Commands can be combined into scripts for automation.
4. **Efficiency**: Allows quick execution of complex tasks.
5. **Remote Access**: Can be used to control remote systems.
6. **Customizability**: Users can customize their environment with aliases, environment variables, and more.
7. **Powerful Utilities**: Offers powerful tools like file manipulation, process management, and network operations.

Types of command line: Each type serves different purposes and offers unique features depending on the user's needs and the operating system.

| Name                      | platform     | description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Command Prompt (CMD)      | Windows      | The default CLI for Windows, used for file and system management. |
| PowerShell                | Windows      | A more advanced CLI and scripting environment for Windows, offering powerful automation capabilities |
| Bash (Bourne Again Shell) | Linux, macOS | A widely used shell in Unix-based systems, known for its powerful scripting and command capabilities |
| Zsh (Z Shell)             | Linux, macOS | An extended version of Bash with additional features like better customization and auto-completion. |
| Terminal                  | macOS, Linux | A generic CLI interface used to run shells like Bash, Zsh, etc. |
| TTY (TeleTYpewriter)      | Unix, Linux  | A low-level text interface providing direct system interaction. |
| CLI Tools and Interfaces  | Various      | Specific command-line tools or interfaces provided by software applications (e.g., Git CLI, Docker CLI) |



### Directory Management 

We have discussed 7 different types of command line interface, but here we utilize just two types namely; command prompt(CMD) and Terminal. I will be showing the commands of how to create files and folder, move them around to different directory, renaming, and deleting. Instead I will make it an interactive session.

#### Command Prompt

 Command prompt is strictly for window. First you need choose a directory preferably Desktop. Create folder/directory called `command-line-basic`, open the folder. Open the command prompt windows; `windows key`, type `cmd` and enter. Navigate to the your directory `command-line-basic` by typing `cd` in the command prompt window and simply drag and drop your `command-line-basic`  folder in and hit on enter.

Some basic command we will be utilizing:

| Command | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cd      | change directory - navigate from one directory to another back and forward. cd `name of the directory` will navigate into that directory and `cd ..` will navigate your one step backward. |
| mkdir   | Make directory - this create a new directory/folder          |
| echo. > | Create a new file - the echo command with angle bracket is follow with the name of file. |
| ren     | Rename - give a file new name                                |
| del     | Delete - delete command is followed by the name of the file you wish to delete |

**File Management:**

*  Open the command prompt windows; type `cd` drag and drop your `command-line-basic` folder into you command line and hit on enter key. Now you can create files and folders inside of your `command-line-basic`
* Use `mkdir foldername` to create a folder, move into the newly created folder using `cd` with the folder name.  `dir` to list the sub-directories hence it is empty nothing will shop up.
* Create text.txt file using; `echo. > text.txt`. Use `dir` command, 
  * We can open this file in notepad and add some text to it. Type `notepad text.txt`, add some text content , save, and close.
* Open the text file in notepad with `notepad text.txt`. You may see `ECHO is on.` inside of the file. This text is generated by the echo command. You update this file with anything, but do not forget to save before you exit.
* This file can be rename using the command line. With renaming you need to provide the old file name with the file extension lastly the new file and name; `ren text.txt newtext.txt`. Make sure the file is not open in any application.
* Use the `del newtext.txt` to delete. Run `dir` to confirm

**Folder Management:**

Let's move to creating, renaming, deleting, and moving folders. Lastly we will see how to copy and move file from one directory to another. Still within the `command-line-basic` directory:



* **Create a new directory and file:** 
  
  * Command to create a new directory/folder is `mkdir foldername`. 
  * For our case is `mkdir java-1`
  * Navigate into newly create `java-1` folder using the `cd` command
  
  * Create new files in it `test1.txt`, `test-2.txt` , and `test-3.txt`. 
  * Create a folder into `java-1` called `test-folder`
  
* **Moving the files and folder:**

  * Be cautious of your working directory `Desktop\command-line-basic\java-1>`. To have access to a file and folder you must be within its root directory.
  * Move `test-1.txt` into `test-folder` with; `move test-1.txt test-folder`. 
  * The `move` command can be use to move folder/directory
  * Create a new folder/directory called `t` and move `test-folder` into in.

* **Rename a folder** 

  * Renaming a file and folder/directory is a lot easy with the `ren` command.
  * Let's rename `t` directory inside `testfolder` to `t-folder`
  * Rename one of the files with `ren` command

* **Delete a folder** 

  * Deleting a file and a folder is possible with a `del` command
  * Let's delete a file with `del` and folder/directory
  * with `del` command. Deleting folder will prompt you.




#### Terminal & Bash

If you are on Mac or Linux this will work for you.

Dealing with Folder:

* **Creating files and folder/directory:**
  * Create a folder/directory with `mkdir` and the name of, while `touch` for  file with the name
  * First create a folder/directory called `command-line-basic` using  `mkdir` command; `mkdir command-line-basic`
  * Navigate to newly created directory with change directory command; `cd command-line-basic`
  * Create three new file with  single `touch` command and space in between each file; `touch test-1.txt test-2.txt test-3.txt`. 
  * List all the new created file with `ls` command.

* **Moving files and folders/directories:**
  * Moving a file or a directory is done with `mv` command plus the destination.
  * Now is time to move one file into `t` directory;  `mv test-1.txt t`. Run the `ls`, you will see `test-1.txt` file.
  * `cd` into `t` and run the `ls`

* **Renaming files and folders:**
  * Using `mv` to rename files and directories;
  * Give a new name to `text-1.txt`; `mv text-1.txt. text-one.txt`. Run `ls` to confirm
  * `cd ..` to `command-line-basic`, change the name of `t`  directory to `t-one`. Run `ls` to confirm.

* **Deleting files and folders:**
  * The `rm` is use to delete a file and `rm -rf` for directory
  * Run `pwd` to know your present working directory. Be sure it is `command-line-basic`. And if you would run `ls` you'd see two files(`test-2.txt  test-3.txt`) and `t` directory
  * Let's remove `test-2.txt` file; `rm test-2.txt` and run `ls` 
  * Delete `t` directory which contains; `rm -rf t` and run `ls`

## Java On The Command Line 

Before we finally install an Integrated Development Environment aka IDE to write and compile our Java code we will learn how to use the command line with a notepad to write our first Java program.

Tip: If you're using Windows I highly recommend you download and install [git](hppt://git-scm.com) which comes with a `bash terminal` the Windows PowerShell or the command prompt in some Windows computers cannot run some bash commands. The `bash` is the default for Mc OS and Linux, so therefore, if you're on Mc or Linux life is good! 



Let's get into it:

* Let's begin by creating a directory/folder on our Desktop preferably named it java.

* Mac and Linux: Search for the terminal from your launcher and open it.

* Windows: Press on the `Windows key`, type `Git Bash`and open it.

* You want to make sure these two windows and next to each other meaning: both should be visible to you on your screen:

  * <img src="C:/Users/ABDOU-JOBE/OneDrive/Documents/project/under-doz/under-doz/assets/side-by-sid.PNG"/>

* Type `cd` in your terminal or Git Bash and then space

* Drag and drop your Java folder in the terminal or Git Bash. You should see something like this 'cd C:\Users\ebrima\Desktop\java' then click on the enter key this should take you to the java directory/folder.

* Let's confirm we are sitting in the right directory, type `pwd` and these should show up as `/c/Users/ebrima/Desktop/java`. Of course a different username, mine is ebrima.

* Type `touch Main.java` and press enter this will create a file name Main or Main.java.

* Run the `ls` command to see the file you just created.

* You can double-click on the file to open it with Notepad in your File Explorer or use the terminal by typing the name of your text editor and the file name with the file extension. `notepad Main.java` and enter on Windows. On Mac and Linux refer to your default text editor.

* Copy the following code snippets and paste them into your file opened in Notepad then `Ctrl+s` to save.

  ```java
  public class Main {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
  		System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
  }
  ```

* Run `cat Main.java` this will preview the content of the file in your terminal or Git Bash. Now we are in good shape, let's try to compile this code by invoking the java-compiler.

* Run `javac Main.java` in your terminal or Git Bash. Hope you do not see anything coming out? that's perfect because your code has been compiled successfully.

* Run `ls` you see two files all named Main but with different file extensions (.java, and .class).

* Now is the time to execute our code to see the print message. Run `java Main.java ` or just `java Main` not `Main.class`.

* Congratulations if you see Hello World! printed in your terminal or Git Bash

* Let's modify our program a bit, move to Notepad, copy the code below, and paste the code below the first print statement.

* ```java
  System.out.println(2+2)
  ```

* Save it go to your terminal and run `javac Main.java` to compile it again. Am sure this time an error is going to be thrown at you because we don't terminate `;` the print statement we just added. Have spotted it?

* Correct the error, save it, compile it, and execute it you should see Hello World! and 4.
