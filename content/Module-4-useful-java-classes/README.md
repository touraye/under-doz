# What To Learn

In this module, we will explore Java classes, starting with a foundational understanding of what a class is. Next, we will take a deep dive into specific classes you will interact with throughout your programming journey. Java is a highly versatile language, and as a result, it offers a vast library of prebuilt classes that developers rely on extensively. Among these, some of the most commonly used classes include `String`, `Scanner`, `Math`, `NumberFormat`, and `Date`. By focusing on these examples, we will demonstrate how classes streamline coding tasks and enhance efficiency in Java applications.
