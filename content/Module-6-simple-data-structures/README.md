# Simple Data Structures

A data structure consist of consist of a numbered of data items chunked  so that they can be treated as one unit of storage. Throughout the course we have learned and also created variables that holds only single unit of value even though the value can change within the lifecycle of a program. Data structures allows us to store more than values in a single variable. Data structures can be categorize int two **simple data structure**; in this module we will learn about **arrays** and **complex data structures**. 

In this module we will learned how to initialize an declared an Array. We will also learned about types of Arrays; **[one-dimensional]()** and **[two-dimensional]()** Array. We will also dive into use case were a choice the right type of Array depending on the problem at hand. The **[concept of parrel array]()** will be discuss solving a problem. 

Topic to cover:

1. [What is an array]()

2. [Types of Arrays - One and Multi-dimensional Array]()

3. [Declaring an array]()

4. [Initializing an Array]()

5. [Operations on Array]()

6. [Manipulating an Array ]()

7. [Iterating through an Array]()

8. [Parallel Array]()
